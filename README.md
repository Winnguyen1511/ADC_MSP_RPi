# ADC_MSP_RPi
I2C communication RPi3 -> MSP430, STM32

I use Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as Master, which doesn't have any ADC peripheral, to collect data from MSP430 and STM32. Both MSP430G2553 and STM32F103C8T6 has temperature sensor and ADC peripheral. So they play as Slave.

Note: you should check "sudo i2cdetect -y 1" to check the device address of stm and msp before run on RPI

Good luck
